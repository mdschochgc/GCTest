This is a very simple example of an R Markdown file.  R Markdown 
provides a simple authoring framework for what we will do in 
our Data Science course.  It will serve as one of the vehicles 
for you to submit your work. In addition to being a simple 
report authoring tool, R Markdown allows you to insert 
code and the resulting text and graphical outputs into your 
final document. 

For our purposes, we will use R Markdown to create a PDF 
output file. 

NAME:  [insert your name here]

DATE:  [insert the date here]

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Our R code is stored in chunks as identifed by the section 
in grey below.  

In this example, we have two chunks.  The first chunk 
runs some simple setup commands. The second chunk performs 
a brief graphical analysis using a built-in R data frame. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(tinytex)
```


```{r}
# Type your name inside the quotation marks on the line beloe
name = "                      "
name

plot(cars)

```


You can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.  We'll do that later when our reports require more code. 

To run the notebook, press *Ctrl+Shift+R*

To see the outout after you run the notebook, press *Ctrl+Shift+K*. 
If all runs cleanly, a PDF file will appear.

When you save the notebook, a PDF file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).



The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
