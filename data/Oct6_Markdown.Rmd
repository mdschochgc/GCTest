## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(tinytex)
# we also will insert any data frames that need to be read
load(url("https://github.com/mdschochgc/GCTest/blob/main/data/sept30.rda?raw=true"))
load(url("https://github.com/mdschochgc/GCTest/blob/main/data/sept14b.Rda?raw=true"))

```

## October 6 Classwork

```{r "TEST", error = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

# insert your R commands on the next lines


  

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
