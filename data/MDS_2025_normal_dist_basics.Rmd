# ====================================================================
# R SCRIPT: INTRODUCING THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
# ====================================================================

# This script demonstrates the visual and statistical elements of the
# Normal (Gaussian) Distribution using base R plotting functions.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. SETUP AND PARAMETERS
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Normal Distribution is defined entirely by its Mean and Standard Deviation.
# Let's set the center and spread for our simulated data.
set.seed(42)  # Set seed for reproducible results
NUM_SAMPLES <- 10000
MEAN_MU <- 100 # The center of the distribution
SD_SIGMA <- 10 # The spread of the distribution (CHANGED from 15 to 10)

# Generate 1000 random data points following a normal distribution
normal_data <- rnorm(NUM_SAMPLES, mean = MEAN_MU, sd = SD_SIGMA)

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. VISUALIZATION: DENSITY CURVE (No Histogram)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Calculate density once to get the curve data and plot boundaries
density_calc <- density(normal_data)

# Create the plot, drawing only the smooth, theoretical density curve (the "bell curve").
plot(density_calc,
     main = "Normal Distribution with Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7)",
     xlab = paste("Data Values (Mean =", MEAN_MU, ", SD =", SD_SIGMA, ")"),
     ylab = "", # Removed Y-axis label
     yaxt = 'n', # Suppressed Y-axis ticks and labels
     col = "#0077b6", # Color of the bell curve line
     lwd = 3,
     ylim = c(0, max(density_calc$y) * 1.1) # Adjust height for labels
)


# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. EMPIRICAL RULE DEMONSTRATION (68-95-99.7)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7) ---
# For a Normal Distribution, approximately:
# 68% of the data falls within 1 Standard Deviation (SD) of the Mean.
#   (i.e., between 90 and 110, since 100 +/- 10)
# 95% of the data falls within 2 Standard Deviations (SDs) of the Mean.
#   (i.e., between 80 and 120, since 100 +/- 20)
# 99.7% of the data falls within 3 Standard Deviations (SDs) of the Mean.
#   (i.e., between 70 and 130, since 100 +/- 30)
# ------------------------------------------

# Highlight the middle areas first so lines and text appear on top.
# Maximum density height for shading rectangle, calculated in Section 2.
